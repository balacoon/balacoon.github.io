Balacoon is a set of tools and resources for Text-to-Speech (TTS).
We focus on developing easy-to-use packages with minimal dependencies
and pre-packed models to be used in production or research.

There are three main directions, that are pursued:

- speech synthesis solution that you can just plug into your own project,
  when you need an artificial speech. This can be a replacement for costly
  cloud services or off-the-shelf starting point in your pet project.
- TTS building blocks that might be helpful in data processing for your
  own research. For example, you can fully rely on Balacoon text processing,
  while developing your own speech synthesis models. This can save time,
  enhance reproducibility and simplify the workflow.
- Proprietary solutions that wrap speech technologies into products.
  Unfortunately you won't be able to use those on your own, but check out demos
  and reach out if you have any questions, inquires.
