Balacoon provides a multitude of tools for different use cases.
 - Python packages: use freely-available pre-compiled wheels for x86_64 Linux in your applications. Other platforms still need to be supported. Let us know what should be a priority.
 - Docker images: run a self-hosted service on NVIDIA GPU that can replace costly cloud providers and serve hundreds of parallel requests.
 - Cloud services: reach out to get credentials and power your product with unique state-of-art voice technology.
