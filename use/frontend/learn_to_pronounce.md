**Frontend** uses pre-packed resources and models
to add pronunciations to the words. Pronunciation is either
looked up in a dictionary or generated using a model.

Check **learn_to_pronounce**
([github](https://github.com/balacoon/learn_to_pronounce), 
[documentation](../../../packages_docs/learn_to_pronounce/index.html)) package,
you can add pronunciations for custom words or adjust existing ones. 
It works with pronunciation resource repositories:
