# Changelog
Here you can find what's new in the Revoice app. Keep up with the updates to get the latest features.

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.9.6**
Synthesis from text is introduced!
Now you can synthesize audio with any voice from text.
For now, only english is supported.

# **Version 1.8.6**
This is the version after the app suspension by Google. We had to include an audio watermark to comply
with the [Manipulated Media Policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9888077#!?zippy_activeEl=manipulated-media%23manipulated-media).
The audio watermark indicates to people that the audio is not authentic. 
We hear from the users that it can be a blocker when it comes to using converted audio in the content,
and we are looking for ways around it. Stay tuned.

#### What's New
- Audio watermark introduced
