Here at Balacoon, we develop speech-generation technology.
Classic single- and multi-speaker text-to-speech solutions are distributed as Freeware. We ship easy-to-use packages with minimal dependencies
and pre-packed models for production or research. 
More cutting-edge technology, such as zero-shot Voice Conversion and Speech Synthesis, finds its way into products. Our vision is that artificial speech generated with state-of-the-art technology will be widely adopted in content creation, given a giant leap in naturalness and flexibility over the past years.

All the artifacts you can find around here (packages, models, containers)
are distributed with [MIT license](/license.html).
