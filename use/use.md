For now all the Balacoon tools are distributed as pre-packed
python packages for x86_64 Linux. We plan to add support of
other platforms on best effort basis. Drop an email, if you
want to bump a priority of certain distribution method.
Internally all the tools are written in C++, so ideally
it would be a matter of packaging to satisfy your needs.

Check the available tools on the left, but our best guess,
is that you are here for [TTS](tts.md).
