Balacoon is a set of tools and resources for Text-to-Speech (TTS).
We focus on developing easy-to-use packages with minimal dependencies
and pre-packed models for production or research. 
There are three main directions we look into:

- Speech synthesis solution that you can plug into your work
  when you need artificial speech. Balacoon can replace costly
  cloud services or be an off-the-shelf starting point in your project.
- TTS building blocks that might be helpful in data processing for your
  research. For example, you can rely on Balacoon text analysis
  while developing speech synthesis models. It can save time,
  enhance reproducibility and simplify the workflow.
- Disruptive technologies that aim to introduce new use cases
  and applications for speech generation.
  To keep a competetive advantage, we provide them as services.
